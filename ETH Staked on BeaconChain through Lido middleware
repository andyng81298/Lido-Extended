/*
This query calculates:
    - Lido deposits since 2020-11-03 on a daily basis + cumulative
    - Other projects deposits since 2020-11-03 on a daily basis + cumulative
    - All projects deposits since 2020-11-03 on a daily basis + cumulative
    
Calculation details:
    - Gather all deposit and withdrawal txs with project labels:
        - Get all deposit txs and assign project labels to them (using dune.lido.result_eth_depositors_labels)
        - Get all withdrawal txs with project labels to them from dune.lido.result_withdrawals_transactions_assigned_to_projects
    - Calculate ETH deposits for Lido (daily and cumulative)
    - Calculate Total ETH deposits for all projects (daily and cumulative)
    - Finally we get a resulting table with daily and cumulative deposits for Lido, Other Projects and Total.
